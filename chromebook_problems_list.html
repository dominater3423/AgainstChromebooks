    <h1>Complaining about Chromebooks</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Full Keyboard</li>
        <p>Chromebook generally have small builds and this necessarily dictates the size of the keyboard. This means that Chromebooks come with many keys that many find useful, like the function keys page up/down.</p>
        <li>Blocked websites</li>
        <p>Go guardian is installed on our devices which blocks many pages off the internet, even the ones that may be helpful for research.</p>
        <li>Blocked Developer Mode</li>
        <p>Developer mode is blocked which means no terminal access, no Linux chroots, and no root access.</p>
        <li>All Extensions are Blocked Except the ones Explicitly Allowed by the Admin.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Android Apps are Blocked</li>
        <p>Android apps are blocked, this could open up students to download ebook readers and media players.</p>
        <li>Crappy Hardware</li>
        <p>Nobody likes running slow computers, I am no exception.</p>
        <li>Chrome OS is not Customizable</li>
		<p>You can't manipulate the launcher, you can't install extensions that change the way you interact with the interface, and generally hostile to users who enjoy to tinker.</p>
        <li>Limited Software</li>
        <p>Mac and Windows devices have a vastly superior ecosystem for software that has been developed for the platform. Chomre OS certainly does not, though it may improve with time.</p>
        <li>Inspect Element is Blocked</li>
        <p>Good luck doing web development on a Chromebook with inspect element blocked.</p>
        <li>Limited Storage</li>
        <p>With a Chromebook you are expected to save everything in the cloud, this is very inconvenient for people like me who don't especially wish all my files to be sent to Google's servers.</p>
