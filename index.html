			This is a website created by six kids for a web design class, I won't list last names; the list goes as follows: Dominic,
			Cynthia, Joshua, David, Cynthia, Roman, and Zack. This project is for our intersession class, a couple week program where
			we take a break from our normal clases, which covered web design. Intersession is a two-week program, but this class lasted
			across all four, so eight weeks in total. For our second intersession we learned how to work in teams, learning git/github.
			This project was to prove our understanding; we just had to create a website about anything we wish, just not anything
			too vulgar, and do the collaboration aspect over on github. We chose to complain about our Chromebooks, for they greatly
			handicap us in our computing. The website might not blow you away for the arguements presented, that's not really the
			point, but hopefully you'll appreaciate the fact that we high schoolers wrote it ourselves.
