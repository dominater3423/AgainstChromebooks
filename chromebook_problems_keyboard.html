  The Problem with Chromebook Keyboards
  </h1>
  <p>
        We all know that the keyboard to a computer can dictate its feel and personal value.
        Computers such as the chromebook have been increasingly moving towards a more compact build to increase the ease of transportation.
        In return, they have removed many helpful and handy features adored by all.
        For example, many of the beloved features on full keyboards, like function key are not present on the chromebook which limits their versatility and tools.
        The function keys (F1-F12) each have their own special command that can help the average computer user when browsing the web.
        In this case the F1 key is usually the default key to "help" in most websites, F3, opens a seach feature for many programs, F5 is a reload command, F7 is a spellcheck, F11 is a enter or exit between fullscreen, etc.
        As you can see, missing these tools can result in a negative experience for inexperienced users.

        Similar to the removal of the function keys on keyboards, the chromebook has also removed the media keys, special keys,  and number pad.
        While these are not as used by most people, they are certaintly important and each have a special purpose to make the experience easier for normal users.
        Things as simple as the page up and down keys, which can be used to scroll up and down on pages are not availiable.
        Another problem regarding the keyboard is the tactile feel of the keys.
        Unlike most other full keyboards, they keyboard on the chromebook is very flat and not raised leading to many errors where you end up clicking multiple keys at the same time.
        This can cause many problems for inexperienced typers, as their finger placement on keys may be off resulting in them mistyping the word they wanted to spell.
